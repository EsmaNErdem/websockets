# GroupChat

GroupChat is an Express-based web application that uses websockets to enable live, multi-room chat functionality. Websockets are used to maintain real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server. This allows users to chat with each other instantly without the need for regular HTTP requests, which are stateless.
# Features

* Real-time Chat: GroupChat provides real-time chat functionality, allowing users to send and receive messages instantly.

* Multi-Room Support: Users can create or join different chat rooms, each with its own set of users and conversations.

* User Interaction: Users can send messages and chat with others in the same room.

* Clean and Reusable Code: The application follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure clean, organized, and reusable code.

# Tech Stack

GroupChat is built using the following technologies:

* Node.js/Express: The backend server is powered by Node.js and the Express framework, making it efficient and scalable.

* HTML and JavaScript: The frontend of the application uses HTML and JavaScript for user interaction and displaying chat messages.

* Websockets: Websockets are utilized to establish and maintain real-time connections between clients and the server.
